OTHER_DETAILS : Opera supports Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Ethereum Web3 dapps. This means that you can now create Web3 dapps that feel like native apps. Your dapp can have it’s own icon on the home screen, a native look & feel (browser UI is not shown), with dynamic local caching and even notifications. All of this while being able to use the Opera Web3 Provider and signing capability. We’d love to see more developers use this capability!
